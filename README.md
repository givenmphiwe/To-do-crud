# To-do-crud

Backend folder
*It the fold where we store our database using Postgresql 
To start the server open it with node server.js in the terminal the server will start 
Then after that you open postgreSQL (pgAdmin) press dropdown button (servers)  
Under PostgreSQL in Databases --press- create Database name it "testdb"

The server will create the tables needed for the database in Postgre once the {testdb} is create in the databases

# crud-backend 
(Lavarel)
This folder is used for backend of the registration auntheticate user's and post the user's info in the database
The database in this folder will be stored in pgAdmin. You will have to create the database table and the column

name the table Users
id(PRI,int)
name(varchar)
password(varchar)

# Front-end folder
(React native) here is the link to the front-end it could not be included is too big https://github.com/givenmphiwe/Front-en
The folder container front end .The documents for front end are located in the src/Components..
The front end communicates with the server.js and Lavarel to store user's database in the pgAdmin
I have nothing more to say you can run the web app with react native  and don't forget to change the localhost to your pc to run succesful
